# polarCode
including my learning record about polar code
we use c to implement the polar code encoder on the DEV platform
the path of the original data should be set correctly
by changing the CODE_LENGTH we can get different length of the code
by viewing the key variable such as polarCode,per_level,per_times and level,we can understand the process of the encoding
